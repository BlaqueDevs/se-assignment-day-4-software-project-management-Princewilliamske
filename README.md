# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
ensure that deadlines are met?
Why timely delivery matters:
 Happy clients.
 Staying within budget.
 Beating the competition.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall:
  Like: Building a house from blueprint to finish, step-by-step.
  Good for: Projects where you know exactly what you want upfront.
  Bad for: Changing your mind mid-build; fixing big problems late.
  
Agile:
  Like: Building with Lego; small pieces, constant updates, you can change as you go.
  Good for: Projects where you're still figuring things out, and need to change often.
  Bad for: Projects needing a very strict, fixed plan; very large projects.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile:
  Good for:
    Changing stuff a lot.
    Not knowing exactly what you want.
    Making apps or websites.
 Example:
    Building with blocks, changing as you go.
    
Waterfall:
  Good for:
    Knowing exactly what you want.
    Things that need a strict plan.
    Building bridges or planes.
  Example:
    Following a recipe step-by-step.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
 How:
    Test little parts, then big parts.
    Have others check your work.
    Use computers to test.
  Why:
    No bugs = happy people.
    Good name = more trust.
    Fixing early = cheaper.
 Scope & WBS:
  Scope:
    Say exactly what the project will do.
    Stops extra stuff being added.
  WBS:
    Break the project into small tasks.
    Helps you see all the work.
    Helps you plan and track the work.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project Scope (What it is):
  Like drawing a line around what the project will do.
  Keeps you from adding extra stuff later.
  
Why Scope is Good:
  Everyone knows what to do.
  No surprise work.
  Better plans.
  Finish on time.
  
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):

  Breaks big jobs into small ones.
  
Why WBS is Good:
  See all the work.
  Plan better.
  Track progress.
  Know who does what.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Project Schedule:
  Know what to do and when.
  See problems early.
  Keeps everyone informed.
  Finish on time.
  
Gantt Charts:
  Show all tasks on a timeline.
  Show which tasks need to come first.
  See if you're on time.
